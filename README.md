fast http server lib for caching HTTP reverse proxy
Background
A reverse proxy is a server that forwards requests to one or more backend servers.

Traditionally, this has been done by configuring the reverse proxy with the address of each backend, and then having it send a request to a backend for each request it receives from a client.
